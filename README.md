## Day 19

This was the worst and the only puzzle for which I had to go looking for hints.
These did the trick:

* Always build a Geode robot and ignore other options in that case.
* Skip states after a certain amount of time.

## Day 22

cube stuff ...

## Day 24

This took me a while - as so often, it was about finding the right cache key.
But then, the whole puzzle ran in a bit more than a minute.
